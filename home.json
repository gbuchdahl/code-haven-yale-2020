Many middle schools in New Haven donâ€™t have computer science programs. Yale has a wealth of computer science knowledge in its students, faculty, and resources. We want to combine the two worlds and increase interest and awareness of computer science in local schools.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/index.md","sha":"6028b905c1d3f9b1f4da73497f8ad2421af2bd52"},"files":[{"path":"/static/img/img_4009.jpeg","sha":"5cfd8b23d71966081c132f0bbbc70563036b2cc0"},{"path":"/static/img/2.jpeg.jpg","sha":"fc42efc3bd6d01c9b6774c792758df19401acc4d"},{"path":"/static/img/1.jpeg.jpg","sha":"14493907fd0d9ed6b690f2747b1a186d811a250a"},{"path":"/static/img/2.jpeg-3.jpg","sha":"9bd8156f90716df26ff8a52a498736e7e000a8be"}]},"timeStamp":"2020-04-01T18:59:45.318Z"}
