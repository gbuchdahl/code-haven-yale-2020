# For Yale Students: Become a Mentor!

Interested in becoming a mentor, role model, leader, and teacher for students in New Haven? We take on new members at the start of every semester, and our onboarding process is quick and painless. We’ll just ask that you sit down for a short interview to get to know you, and then attend a workshop to help prepare you for the classroom. No prior teaching experience is necessary -- only patience, the willingness to learn, and an interest in our goals! Also, don't worry if you don't have formal computer science experience!

Plus, as a member, you’ll be able to:
  -  Gain confidence in your programming skills by teaching children!
  -  Give back to the New Haven community
  -  Meet other Yale students interested in Computer Science
  -  Get t-shirts, stickers, tote bags, and more!

*Applications are now closed.* Check in next semester for more opportunities! 


# For Teachers: Bring Code Haven to Your Classroom!

We’re excited to announce that Code Haven will be continuing virtually this year. We understand that schools are facing unique challenges this year, and we are committed to adapting to your classroom’s needs.

Our current curriculum is designed for middle school students with no computer science experiences, with lessons for an hour a week. Code Haven classes are designed to work best with synchronous online learning, but we have plans in place to adapt to any classroom environment. If this sounds interesting, [shoot us an email!](mailto:codehavenyale@gmail.com)
