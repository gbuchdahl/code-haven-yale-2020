## About Us

We are an undergraduate student organization at Yale University dedicated to introducing students to computer science starting at a young age. Every week, Yale students teach computing lessons at several schools in the New Haven district, engaging the students with online lessons, group activities, and class-wide demonstrations. Our organization receives teacher training from Lead Program Manager of Microsoft Teals, Nathaniel Granor (Yale alumnus ’09) and David Weinreb, a 6th grade teacher at Fair Haven School.


## History

Code Haven was founded in Fall 2016 by Annie Chen ‘19 and Dennis Duan ‘19 with the support of Professor Dana Angluin and Yale alumnus Nathaniel Granor ‘09. A pilot semester was launched in Dave Weinreb’s sixth grade classroom at Fair Haven School, with 18 students and 6 mentors. In October 2016, Code Haven received funding from Google IgniteCS for its effort in impacting the local community through computer science mentorship. By 2020, Code Haven has grown into a student organization with almost 50 members, serving nearly 170 students in New Haven and implementing a computer science curriculum in 7 middle-school classrooms.
